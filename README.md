# Click With Keyboard #
=============

Do you love keyboard shortcuts?
Do you hate using your mouse?
Do you just wanna look cool in front of your 0 friends?
You need to be able to click shit in a browser sometimes, even when it's not a clickable element.
I gotchu, B!

1. Just highlight text as you would with Control + F.
2. Press the escape key. The text is now highlighted.
3. Press F3, and the browser will act as if you just clicked the beginning of the highlighted text.
4. Voila! You can now click text with your keyboard, even if it is not a clickable element, like a button or a link.
